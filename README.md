# Welcome to my CS7211 repo
**This is where I'll be hosting my working files for the Foundations of CS B course**

Everything here is very begginer, if you're a fellow student feel free to have
a look; the course is structured in a way that you can only learn from each other,
so enjoy. 

I've got [my study notes available here](https://publish.obsidian.md/jazzbeau)
